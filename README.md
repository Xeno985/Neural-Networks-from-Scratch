# Neural-Networks-from-Scratch

This repository contains all the code I wrote during my Summer of Code project under WnCC, IIT Bombay.

## Week 0:

Going through the fundamentals of Python programming and numpy library.

## Week1:

What a neural network was and the math behind forward propagation

Hardcoded a simple neural network with three layers and given architecture.

## Week2:

Backward propagation math 

Coded in classes network and forward 

## Week3:

More on backward propagation and overall structure of code

Coded in classes for backward propagation and sigmoid activation

## Week4:

Coded in the rest of the supporting classes like other activations and losses.

## Week5:

Convolutional Neural Network math and code implementation.

Coded in the convolution class [(conv2d.py)](https://github.com/Xeno985/Neural-Networks-from-Scratch/blob/main/conv2d.py)
